html5-mp3-id3v2-reader
======================

HTML5/JS id3v2 tag editor.

Yet another exercise of binary fun in a modern web browser.

This is a completely client side id3v2 tag editor.  It allows you to read some general information from an mp3 file, update the text fields, and save your changes.  You can even see and change (or add) the album cover.

Hooray boredom!

You can check out the live version [here][1].
